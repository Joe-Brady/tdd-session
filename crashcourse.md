# TDD crash course plan

- Intro - different types of testing, TDD/BDD with all of it.
- Sometimes hard to do TDD if you don't know the language or library. How to tackle that? (mini spike then re-write)
- Qualms with TDD? Post-it-note on wall to track if we tackle those issues.
- Brainstorm ideas for functions to write / story to tell. Should be medium complexity.
- Choose one or two.
- In pairs, write function without tests. Perhaps driver/navigator?
- Trial and error until it works.
- Then write the tests. Try to work out what to test and how etc.
- Perhaps a different function for next step?
- Write comments to describe what the function has to do
- Describe the different ways to approach WHEN to write tests
- In pairs, decide whether to write all tests up front or one at a time
- Ping pong pairing - write tests and code. Make sure the tests break first.
- MINIMUM amount of code. Try to 'cheat' your way to making the other person's test pass
- Any way to refactor? Check if tests still pass.
- Brainstorm the 'new feature' of the function.
- What's the first thing we need to do to add this new feature?
- Write the new test(s) first, then write the code
- Identify/come up with a bug that's not caught by tests.
- New test that breaks to highlight bug, then fix.
- Component testing? BDD?
- Were your fears resolved?
